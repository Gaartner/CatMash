# CatMash
 CatMash is a fun mini web application where users can vote for the cutest cat from a random selection of adorable cat photos. Based on the Facemash user experience, this application offers two distinct pages: a voting page to compare cats and a ranking page to see the most popular cats. CatMash is an open-source project accessible from any web browser.
